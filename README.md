<h1 align="center">Secure-Store</h1>

Secure-Store is a privacy-focused, end-to-end encrypted password manager designed with a zero-trust architecture. It ensures that your sensitive credentials remain secure and accessible only to you. Built with a Go backend and a Vite-powered React web extension, Secure-Store leverages `libsodium` for advanced cryptographic security.

## Features

- **End-to-End Encryption**: All stored passwords are encrypted client-side using `libsodium` before being sent to the server.
- **Zero-Trust Architecture**: The server never has access to your plaintext passwords; only the client can decrypt them.
- **Go Backend**: A lightweight and secure backend for handling user authentication and storage.
- **Vite + React Web Extension**: A fast and modern UI to manage your credentials conveniently in your browser.
- **Secure Key Management**: Utilizes modern cryptographic principles to ensure strong password security.
<!-- - **Cross-Platform**: Works on all major browsers with seamless synchronization. -->

## Security

Secure-Store follows industry best practices:

- Uses `libsodium` for encryption (AES-GCM, XChaCha20-Poly1305)
- Strong client-side key derivation using Argon2
- Secure authentication with token-based access
- Regular security updates
